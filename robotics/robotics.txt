# current plan 

1. build real robot controlled by motors manually 
    1. get two hand assembled, camera and speaker ready
    2. wheels ready and assemble them
    3. build api to control motors on computer through wifi (ROS or other)

2. enable basic skills like human have (vision, listening, speaking, movement, operate object)


3. construct framework for solving real work issue  - build ability (in level of difficulty)
    organizing stuff (move object from one location to another)
    cleaning
    cooking
    washing dishes
    

4. add machine learning capacity for advanced ability(reasoning, memory, learning)
    opencog and other modules
