# current plan 
1. build real robot controlled by motors manually 
    1. get two hand assembled, camera and speaker ready
    2. wheels ready and assemble them
    3. build api to control motors on computer through wifi (ROS or other)
    4. construct software foundation based on ros 

2. integrate hardware to have basic skills like human have (vision, listening, speaking, movement, operate object)

3. build robotic ability framework
    1. sdk 
    2. ability market
    3. web mobile ui and platform integration
    4. developer onboarding

4. build key abilities for solving real work issue  - (in level of difficulty)
    organizing stuff (move object from one location to another)
    cleaning
    cooking
    washing dishes
    
4. research on complex machine learning capacity for advanced ability(reasoning, memory, learning)
    opencog and other modules


# TODO
1. raspberry pi to arduion   http://www.instructables.com/id/Interface-Python-and-Arduino-with-pySerial/
2. research on realsense Autonomous Mobile Robot
3. opencog eva chatbot fix
